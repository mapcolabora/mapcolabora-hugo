# Editorial Workflow.

# By default, saving a post in the CMS interface will push a commit directly to the publication branch specified in backend. However, you also have the option to enable the Editorial Workflow, which adds an interface for drafting, reviewing, and approving posts. To do this, add the following line to your config.yml:
# publish_mode: editorial_workflow # Currently only supported by Github.

# Media folders.
media_folder: "static/img" # Media files will be stored in the repo under static/img
public_folder: "/img" # The src attribute for uploaded media will begin with /img

collections:
  - name: "post" # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/blog
    label: "Post" # Used in the UI
    folder: "content/post" # The path to the folder where the documents are stored
    create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection
    slug: "{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}_{{slug}}" # Filename template, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
    fields: # The fields for each document, usually in front matter
